Problem
Imagine that you’re creating a garment simulator. Your code consists of classes that
represent:
1. A family of related products, say: tops + pants + shoes.
2. Several variants of this family. For example, products tops + pants + shoes are
available in these variants: Professional, Casual, and Party.
Tops Pants Shoes
Professional
Casual
Party
Product families and their variants.
You need a way to create individual garment objects so that they match other objects of
the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching garment.
Also, you don’t want to change existing code when adding new products or families of
products to the program. Garment vendors update their catalogs very often, and you
wouldn’t want to change the core code each time it happens.
